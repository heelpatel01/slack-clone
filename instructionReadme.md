## Week 1: Frontend - Basic UI and User Authentication
## Objective
Set up the UI with Material UI to closely resemble Slack, and build the user authentication flow. Use Vite as the frontend setup tool.

## Tasks
- Set up React App using Vite:
  - Create the React project using Vite for faster development.
  - Install Material UI for components and theming.
- Basic Layout (Material UI, Slack-inspired CSS):
  - Sidebar: Create a sidebar using Material UI's Drawer and List. Style it to resemble Slack‚Äôs sidebar (dark background, white text, with channels listed).
  - Chat Area: Use Material UI's Card or Paper for the chat area. Add a TextField and Button at the bottom for the message input form.
  - Ensure the UI is responsive, using Material UI‚Äôs Grid and Flexbox utilities.
- User Authentication (Frontend):
  - Create a Material UI Dialog for sign-up and login forms.
  - Store the logged-in user‚Äôs information (username and password) in the backend.
  - No need for tokens or exhaustive authentication mechanism in this project.
  - Upon successful login, show the user‚Äôs channel list in the sidebar.
- Routing (React Router):
  - Use React Router for handling different views (e.g., login, signup, chat view).

## Deliverables
- Slack-like layout using Material UI (sidebar, chat area, message input).
- User sign-up and login functionality.
- Responsive design resembling Slack.

## Week 2: Backend - Set Up Authentication, Channels, and Messages
### Objective
Set up the backend with Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, build the API for user authentication, channel management, and messaging. Connect the frontend to the backend.

### Tasks
- Set up Node.js & Express Server:
  - Use Express for setting up the backend, MongoDB for data storage.
  - Install and configure Mongoose for defining models and interacting with MongoDB.
- User Schema:
  - Create a MongoDB schema for Users: username, password, list of channel IDs.
- Channel Schema:
  - Create a MongoDB schema for Channels: name, createdAt, array of user IDs.
- Message Schema:
  - Create a MongoDB schema for Messages: channelId, sender, message, createdAt.
- Authentication Routes:
  - POST /signup: Create a new user with username and password.
  - POST /login: Authenticate the user and return their user information (username, channels).
- Channel Management Routes:
  - GET /channels: Retrieve the channels for the logged-in user.
  - POST /channels: Allow users to create new channels.
- Messaging Routes:
  - GET /channels/:channelId/messages: Fetch all messages for a specific channel.
  - POST /channels/:channelId/messages: Post a new message to the channel.
- Connect Frontend and Backend:
  - Implement login, signup, and display the user‚Äôs channels dynamically.
  - Fetch messages from the backend for each channel.

## Deliverables
- Functional backend with user authentication, channels, and messages.
- Integration of frontend with backend for login, channel display, and messaging.
- Slack-like channel list and message area styled using Material UI.

## Week 3: Frontend - Channel Invitations, Multiple User Views, and Polling
### Objective
Implement channel invitations, multiple user views, and set up HTTP polling to simulate real-time messaging. Continue to enhance UI styling to resemble Slack more closely.

### Tasks
- User-Specific Channel Views:
  - Update the sidebar to show only the channels the logged-in user has access to, ensuring the UI looks like Slack‚Äôs channel list.
- Channel Invitations:
  - Add an invite button in each channel view using Material UI's Button.
  - Open a Dialog or Modal and show list of available users to invite.
  - Send the invite request to the backend (POST /channels/:channelId/invite/:userId/).
  - Verify the userId exists.
  - Add the userId to the list of users in the channel.
- HTTP Polling for Messages:
  - Use setInterval in useEffect to poll the backend every few seconds for new messages.
  - Show new messages dynamically in the chat window without reloading the page.
- Multiple User Views:
  - Log in as different users and ensure each user sees only their own channels. Style the UI to resemble Slack's minimalistic design.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional user-specific views where each user sees only their channels.
- HTTP polling for new messages, updating the chat window in real-time.
- Clean, Slack-like UI with Material UI components and CSS.

## Week 4: Backend Testing, Message Timestamps, and Finishing Touches
### Objective
Implement message timestamps, add error handling, write tests for user access control, channel invitations, and messaging functionality, and fine-tune the UI to resemble Slack.

### Tasks
- Message Timestamps:
  - Use the toLocaleString method or the Intl.DateTimeFormat API to format and display message timestamps in a human-readable format.
  - Ensure that each message in the chat displays when it was sent, styled using Material UI‚Äôs Typography.
- Backend Testing:
  - Write tests using Jest or Mocha for user authentication, channel invitations, and messaging.
  - Test user access control, ensuring users only access their channels and messages.
- Frontend Finishing Touches:
  - Style the message input area, message bubbles, and timestamps to look similar to Slack.
  - Ensure the sidebar, header, and message area are visually appealing and match Slack‚Äôs color palette.
  - Add error handling for invalid input, login failures, and message sending errors.
- Polishing the UI:
  - Ensure that the chat window automatically scrolls as new messages are added.
  - Add a loading spinner or progress indicator while waiting for API responses or during polling.

## Deliverables
- Fully styled, Slack-inspired frontend.
- Working message timestamps and properly tested backend.
- Smooth user experience with real-time updates and error handling.

## Final Core Feature List (after 4 weeks)
- User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in with username and password, stored in the backend.
- Channel Management: Users can create and view only the channels they are invited to.
- Channel Invitations: Users can invite other users to their channels.
- Multiple User Views: Each user sees only their channels (demonstrated through at least two user perspectives).
- Chat Functionality: Users can send messages in the channels they are part of.
- HTTP Polling: Chat window polls for new messages every few seconds.
- Message Timestamps: Messages show when they were sent.
- Backend Testing: Unit tests for user access control, channel invitations, and messaging.
- Slack-like UI: A clean, professional UI using Material UI to resemble Slack.
